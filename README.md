# GemtasticDistanceCalculator
My very first android app.

###About this app###
This is a very simple application which will estimate the distance you travel:
- From when you've first noticed something that makes you slam your breaks, to when you come to a full stop.
- When you look at your phone or something unrelated to driving for 3seconds.

It estimates your stopping distance based off of the speed you're driving at and the condition of the road; 
if it's slippery or not.

This app assumes you have good breaks and tyres.


####Features####
This application features:
- A shake command to return to the main menu after you've gotten your result.
- English and Swedish app language.


####Compatibility####
This application requires Android Gingerbread 2.3 and up to run.
